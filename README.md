This is a slideshow generator created for the student pub [Canossa](http://www.canossa.de) in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany.

The idea is to display an advertisement slide for one minute, then 5 photos for the next minute, and then again an advertisement.
However, the slideshow should not be manually edited every time the overall sets of advertisement slides or photos change.
Thus, we aim for a slideshow generation that takes a directory of advertisement slides and a directory of photos as inputs.

The resulting slideshow is displayed in a browser with the help of the [`diaporama`](http://github.com/gre/diaporama) engine.
We use the project [`diaporama-example1`](https://github.com/gre/diaporama-example1) as a starting point for our project.
